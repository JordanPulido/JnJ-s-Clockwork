### Introduction
JnJ’s Clockwork is an android based alarm mobile application where users are able to set and customize alarms of their choice for daily use. The user will be able to create alarm profiles along with being able to set timers and stopwatches. When connected to its corresponding hardware component, the app furthers its capabilities by allowing users the ability to read local temperatures via the sensor included. The project is designed to give users ease of access to anything time related in a simple and clean formfactor. <br>
<br>
This project consists of the HTU21D-F Temperature/Humidity Sensor for reading local temperature values, a 1.2″ 4-Digit 7-Segment display for displaying current time and temperature readings, and a I2S 3W Class D Amplifier Breakout MAX98357 for audio when an alarm goes off. 

### Budget for Materials Required

### Time Schedule
Realistically, this project should take roughly a weekend to complete if all materials and facilites are available to you. The materials themselves might take a week to arrive due to shipping, but the actual proccess of assembling and programming should not take longer than 3 days. A couple of hours each day can be dedicated towards the different aspects of the project to make time usuage more efficient and effective. For me, this project took around 1 whole semester (4 months) to finish along with an average work time of around 2.5 hours a week. Here is the time schedule I followed: <br>
